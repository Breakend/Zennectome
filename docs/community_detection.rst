Community Detection
**************************

=================
Why?
=================

The goal of the community detection package of Zennectome is to aggregate the various
tools and algorithms across various packages in the wild. You may want to run Louvain
Modularity Maximization with your NetworkX graph, but then it requires finding the
separate community package. Or maybe you want to run something in igraph, but then
you have to convert things. The Zennectome community detection package tries to simplify that.
